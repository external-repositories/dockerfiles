### Info
This is an Alpine Linux (armf architecture) image with with nothing extra in it. It uses the x86_64 version of alpine to create an ARMF base image. It only pulls the miniroot and verifies the SHA256 sum.

On it's own, this image does nothing. It is intended to be used as a base for more interesting things to be built on the Raspberry Pi 3 (including B and B+).
